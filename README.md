# kik_bot
This is just the foundation of what a Kik bot using Tomer's unofficial bot api should look like.

First things first, download pycharm from jetbrains, its the best IDE for working with python in my opinion. The community edition is fine, but if you have the means or you "know" someone with a paid jetbrains account then I definitely recommend getting the Professional edition.

Once you've done that, create a new project, set your interpreter to python 3.8 or you'll run into issues. There will be a file named main.py, delete everything in that file and copy and paste the code from kik_bot.py in this repo into the main.py file in pycharm.

After doing that, open up the terminal within pycharm and clone tomer's api using:
git clone -b new https://github.com/tomer8007/kik-bot-api-unofficial

Now install kik_unofficial:
pip3 install ./kik-bot-api-unofficial

From there you're all set to start creating your very own kik bot, dont forget to fill in the information in kik_bot.py like username, password, etc. I'll be posting my whole project on here soon. If you want to see my bot in action pm @thot.bot69 on kik and say friend to add her to your group
